# github-user-info-c7e4f

A simple web application to update the GitHub user page by adding a status element that reflects the API fetch state.

## Project Overview

This project enhances the GitHub user information page by introducing a status indicator element with the ID `#api-status`. The status element dynamically displays:

- **Loading...** while fetching user data from the GitHub API
- An **empty** status on successful fetch
- **User not found** if the requested user does not exist or the fetch fails

---

## Features

- **Real-time API status indicator** to improve user feedback during data loading
- Handles successful and failed API fetch scenarios gracefully
- Simple and clear status messages
- Non-intrusive UI update by manipulating the status element content dynamically

---

## Setup Instructions

This project is a front-end enhancement and does not require any special setup or backend server.

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the main HTML file (`index.html` or your specific page) in a modern web browser.
3. Ensure the JavaScript responsible for fetching GitHub user data and updating the `#api-status` element is included and properly linked.

---

## Usage Guide

1. Open the GitHub user page or the corresponding webpage where this script is implemented.
2. When you initiate a fetch request for a GitHub user:
   - The status element with ID `#api-status` will display `Loading...`.
3. After the fetch operation:
   - If the user exists, the status element will be cleared (empty).
   - If the user does not exist or the fetch fails, the status element will display `User not found`.

### Example

```html
<div id="api-status"></div>
<script src="fetchUser.js"></script>
```

## Technical Details

- **Status Element:** An HTML element with the ID `api-status` is used to display the current state of the API request.
- **API Fetch Handling:**
  - The status element is set to `"Loading..."` immediately before the fetch call.
  - On a successful API response, the status text is cleared.
  - On an unsuccessful fetch (e.g., HTTP 404), the status text is set to `"User not found"`.
- **Error Handling:** The fetch request includes error catching to handle network issues or invalid usernames gracefully.
- **Compatibility:** Compatible with modern browsers supporting Fetch API and standard DOM manipulation.
